 A Stock Anomaly detection is a project for learning the detection of abnormal instances, called anomalies (or outliers) in the stock market. 
Evaluation Metrics:
F1-score serves as the evaluation metrics for this competition. This metric provides a comprehensive assessment of your model's performance, considering the challenges posed by the dataset's class imbalance. Achieving a balance between high precision (accurately detecting true non-hold anomalies) and high recall (capturing as many non-hold anomalies as possible) will be instrumental in developing strong anomaly detection models.

Get started:
To excel in this competition, you are encouraged to explore various anomaly detection techniques and machine learning algorithms. Consider leveraging unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering or outlier detection algorithms, as well as supervised approaches customized for imbalanced datasets. Additionally, feature engineering and data visualization techniques may prove valuable in extracting meaningful patterns from the stock market dataset.
